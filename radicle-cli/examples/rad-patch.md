When contributing to another's project, it is common for the contribution to be
of many commits and involve a discussion with the project's maintainer.  This is supported
via Radicle's patches.

Here we give a brief overview for using patches in our hypothetical car
scenario.  It turns out instructions containing the power requirements were
missing from the project.

```
$ git checkout -b flux-capacitor-power
$ touch REQUIREMENTS
```

Here the instructions are added to the project's README for 1.21 gigawatts and
commit the changes to git.

```
$ git add REQUIREMENTS
$ git commit -v -m "Define power requirements"
[flux-capacitor-power 3e674d1] Define power requirements
 1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
 create mode 100644 REQUIREMENTS
```

Once the code is ready, we open (or create) a patch with our changes for the project.

```
$ rad patch open --message "define power requirements" --no-confirm
